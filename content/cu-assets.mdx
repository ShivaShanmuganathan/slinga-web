# 🧬 Crypto Unicorn Assets

The Crypto Unicorns ecosystem is powered by a deeply interconnected web of NFTs, tokens, and smart contract-driven systems. Each asset — whether a Unicorn, a piece of Land, or a Lootbox — is not just cosmetic but functional, programmable, and deeply composable onchain. Below is a detailed breakdown of every core asset and how it's designed, structured, and integrated.

## 🦄 Unicorns

Each **Unicorn** is an ERC-721 NFT with unique genetic traits that influence gameplay, farming efficiency, breeding, and PvP. These genetics are encoded directly onchain using **bit manipulation** — allowing for gas-efficient storage and retrieval.

- **8 Primary Classes**: Cloud, Rainbow, Heart, Crystal, Star, Candy, Moon, Flower
- **Genetic Inheritance**: Traits passed down through breeding


### 🔬 Bit Manipulation Structure

Unicorn genetics are stored in a 256-bit integer, where:

- Each gene occupies a fixed number of bits (e.g., 5–8 bits)
- Genes include traits like **color**, **horn type**, **body**, **mane**, **tail**, and **class**
- Extracted using bitwise operations like shifts (`>>`) and masks (`&`)

This compact format reduces storage costs and enables deterministic trait reads entirely onchain.

### 🎮 Gameplay Integration

Unicorns serve as the core playable characters. Their genes determine their eligibility and effectiveness in farming, questing, and skill-based game modes like Jousting and Racing. Certain gene combinations also unlock synergy bonuses on specific Land types.

## 🌑 Shadowcorns

**Shadowcorns**, also ERC-721 NFTs, are rarer and have a unique gene structure focused on PvP and raid specialization. Their genes also use bit manipulation, with additional attributes like **Dark Class**, **Aura Type**, and **Minion Proficiency**.

- **5 Primary Types**: Slime, Volt, Soul, Fire, Nebula
- **Corruption Levels**: Affects minion breeding capabilities
- **Void Signatures**: Unique traits for special abilities

### ⚙️ Genetic Encoding

- Uses the same 256-bit format as Unicorns
- More weight given to PvP-aligned genes (e.g., power type, combat cooldown)
- Affects Shadowforge minion output and raid strategy



### 🧨 Shadowcorn Roles

Shadowcorns act as dark PvP units. They do not participate in farming but instead breed **minions**, which are deployed in factional PvP (e.g., Twilight Tactics). Shadowcorns influence minion strength, cooldown, and class traits.

## 🏞️ Land NFTs

There are **9 unique Land types** in Crypto Unicorns, each classified by rarity and associated with different Unicorn classes:

**Common Lands:** Cloud, Heart, Rainbow, Flower, Candy, OmNom, Crystal, Moon, Star  
**Rare & Mythic Lands:** Special editions designed for high-yield and advanced gameplay.

Each Land NFT impacts resource yield, farming mechanics, and breeding efficiency. Certain Unicorn and Shadowcorn traits perform better on land types aligned with their class genetics.

## 💎 $CU (Crypto Unicorns Token)

$CU is the **governance and premium utility token** of the ecosystem:

- Used for staking, breeding, crafting, and marketplace fees
- ERC-20 token with capped supply
- Earned through gameplay and tournament rewards
- Spent in lootboxes, land sales, PvP entry, and other premium systems

## 🍃 $UNIM (Unicorn Milk)

$UNIM is the **primary in-game soft currency**:

- Used for crafting, farming, questing, and building upgrades
- Burned in breeding, production, and progression systems
- Earned from land-based activities
- Highly deflationary with ongoing burn loops

## 🧬 Minions

Minions are onchain units spawned by Shadowcorns through the **Shadow Forge**. These are used for territory raids, leaderboard competitions, and event-driven faction warfare.

### 🔗 Minion Traits

- Inherit partial genetics from their parent Shadowcorn
- Carry time-limited cooldowns
- Can be upgraded or sacrificed for Dark Marks and seasonal progress

## 💠 Gems

Gems are special consumable NFTs that boost Unicorn or Shadowcorn stats. These are socketed onto characters and influence gameplay outcomes.

- Gems provide passive bonuses in PvP, Jousting, and Racing
- Limited supply; often earned via seasonal events or crafting
- Stored as ERC-1155 tokens and burned on use
