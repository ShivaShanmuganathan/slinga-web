## ü™Ñ Twilight Tactics & Shadowforge

**Twilight Tactics** is a fully onchain, faction-based PvP game mode within the Crypto Unicorns universe ‚Äî designed to pit **Unicorn** and **Shadowcorn** holders against each other in seasonal battles for territory and resources.  
As Lead Solidity Engineer, I designed and deployed the smart contract architecture powering minion generation, territory-based score tracking, and multi-phase reward distribution.
