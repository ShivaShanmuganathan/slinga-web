# üöú The Revolutionary Farm Economy

Crypto Unicorn's farm economy serves as the foundation of its entire ecosystem, creating a perfect balance between casual gameplay and economic incentives.

## üíª Technical Implementation

The farm economy is powered by diamond standard smart contracts:

- [Crypto Unicorns](https://github.com/Laguna-Games/cu-osc-unicorns)
- [Land](https://github.com/Laguna-Games/cu-osc-land)
- [CU Token](https://github.com/Laguna-Games/cu-public)
- [UNIM Token](https://github.com/Laguna-Games/cu-osc-unim)
- [Shadowcorns](https://github.com/Laguna-Games/cu-osc-shadowcorns)
- [Game Bank](https://github.com/Laguna-Games/cu-osc-game-bank)

## üåæ The Farming Mechanics

Crypto Unicorns' farming system is built on three core pillars:

### 1. Land Development

The land NFTs are yield generating properties that form the backbone of the game's economic model.
These lands serve as production centers where players deploy their Unicorn NFTs to perform actions such as farming, gathering, crafting, and questing. 

Each land comes with resource potential, and players can boost productivity by upgrading buildings using materials and tokens like $UNIM and $CU.



### 2. Unicorn Management

- **Breeding**: Players can breed their Unicorns to create new generations
- **Training**: Unicorns can be trained to increase their farming efficiency
- **Farming**: Planting seedbags and harvesting to produce berries, codex pages, and $UNIM
- **Crafting**: Combining raw materials like berries and building resources to generate outputs like potions, scrolls, and quest items
- **Questing**: Using crafted items to complete class quests and unlock lootboxes, which yield further rewards and higher-tier materials
- **Gathering**: A sink mechanism to recycle excess outputs back into the ecosystem
- **Special Abilities**: Each Unicorn has unique genes that affect farming outcomes

### 3. Resource Generation

Players can grow various resources on their land:
- **Crypto Unicorn Currency ($CU)**: The primary in-game currency
- **Unicorn Milk ($UNIM)**: A premium resource used for breeding and upgrades
- **Special Crops**: Seasonal and event-specific resources

## üí∞ Economic Impact

The farm economy has had significant economic implications:

- **$45M in Digital Asset Sales**: Including land NFTs and farming-related items
- **2,000+ ETH in Land Sales**: Demonstrating the value of virtual real estate
- **90%+ User Retention**: Proving the sustainability of the economic model


## ü§ù Social Play: Tribes & Collaboration
Players can form Tribes, pooling materials to complete global goals or unlock tribe-specific crafting and events. Tribe mechanics enhance cooperation and introduce a new layer of strategy to the farming loop.

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è PvP Integration: Shadowcorn Raids

For a darker twist, players who own Shadowcorn NFTs can breed minions and raid Unicorn lands. This introduces an adversarial layer, tying the farming economy with factional PvP and creating resource pressure and burn mechanisms.

## üè¶ Game Bank: The Economic Core of Crypto Unicorns
The Game Bank is the central smart contract vault that underpins the entire Crypto Unicorns economy. It manages key in-game assets such as $RBW, $UNIM, Dark Marks, Lootboxes, Keystones and crafting materials
