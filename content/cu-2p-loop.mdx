        mapping(address => uint256) balances;
    }
    
    mapping(string => Game) public games;
    
    function depositToGame(
        string memory gameId,
        uint256 amount

    function withdrawFromGame(
        string memory gameId,
        uint256 amount
    ) public {
        // Withdrawal logic with permission checks
