# 🌘 Twilight Tactics & Shadowforge

**Twilight Tactics** is the flagship seasonal PvP event in the Crypto Unicorns ecosystem. It introduces large-scale, onchain battles between **Unicorns** and **Shadowcorns**, marking the first-ever implementation of NFT death mechanics and squad-based combat in the CU universe.
This system pits Unicorn holders against Shadowcorn factions in an eternal struggle for resources and dominance.
At its core, Twilight Tactics is fueled by the **Shadowforge** — a minion-generation engine that allows Shadowcorns to breed and lead powerful squads into the Dark Forest, where Unicorns rise to challenge them across five contested regions.
